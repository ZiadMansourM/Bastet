# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to Bastet - [docs](https://www.sreboy.com/Bastet/)

Bastet is a high-level Python package that encourages rapid development
and clean, pragmatic design for FastAPI. Thanks for checking it out.

# Vision: Reusability matters
As in [Django docs](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/4.0/intro/reusable-apps/#reusability-matters), Itâ€™s a lot of work to design, build, test and maintain a web application. Many projects share common problems. Wouldnâ€™t it be great if we could save some of this repeated work?

This is the most important reason I started the Bastet package. Inspired by Django, the well known web framework built by experienced developers.

Bastet will help devlopers automate repeted works, reuse/share apps by blug-and-play, decouple apps logic.
